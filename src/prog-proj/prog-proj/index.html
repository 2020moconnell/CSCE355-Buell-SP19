<H1>CSCE 355 Programming Project<BR>
Fall 2014<BR>
Due November 11, 2014</H1>

<P></P>
<P><H2>Handout</H2></P>
<P>This is the homepage for the programming project for CSCE 355.
Everything involving the project can be linked to from here.</P>
<P>Here is the <A HREF="programming-assignment.pdf">Programming Project
  Handout</A> (updated 9/16/14).  You should read this first.</P>
<P><H2>Self-testing software files</H2></P>
<P>Here is software for you to test your own programs.  I will use
the same software in the grading process, and so I urge you to use it
as well so that you will not have any unpleasant surprises.</P>
<P>There are two .zip files: one unzips to a directory containing various
executables; the other unzips to a directory tree with test files,
both input and output.</P>
<P><H3>Installing the files</H3></P>
<P>I am assuming that you will use this software either on a GNU/Linux system
(such as those available in our Linux labs) or on an Apple Mac running
some recent version of OS X (with Perl&nbsp;5 installed, which is probably
is).  I can't
guarantee that anything will work properly on any other system;
indeed, there are some precompiled binaries that presumably will only
run on one of the two systems, above.</P>
<P>Download these two .zip files to your system:
<OL>
<LI> either <A HREF="bin-linux.zip"><TT>bin-linux.zip</TT></A> or
<A HREF="bin-mac-osx.zip"><TT>bin-mac-osx.zip</TT></A>, depending on your
  system, and
<LI> <A HREF="test-suite.zip"><TT>test-suite.zip</TT></A> (system-independent)
</OL>
to your system.  The first file unzips to a directory named <TT>bin</TT>
containing a handful of executable files.  The second unzips to a
directory tree named <TT>test-suite</TT> containing both input files to
feed to your programs and output files to compare with your programs'
output.  You should be able place these subdirectories virtually
anywhere, except DON'T unzip the files where you already have a
subdirectory named <TT>bin</TT> or <TT>test-suite</TT> if you're at all
worried about files being overwritten.</P>
<P>On the command line, move each zip file to the place where you want the
corresponding subdirectory to be and type<BR>
<TT><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;unzip&nbsp;&lt;zip-file.zip&gt;<BR>
</TT><BR>
for each zip file.</P>
<P>Then, you will need to hand-edit two lines in the file
<TT>project-test.pl</TT> in the <TT>bin</TT> directory.  On line&nbsp;19, change
the path being assigned to the variable <TT>&#36;test&#95;suite&#95;root</TT> to be
the pathname of your current <TT>test-suite</TT> directory (depending on
where you put it in the previous step).  Similarly, on line&nbsp;22,
change the pathname being assigned to the variable <TT>&#36;bin&#95;dir</TT> to
be the pathname of your current <TT>bin</TT> directory.  Note that
<TT>&#36;ENV&#123;HOME&#125;</TT> refers to your home directory.  (The current
settings of these variables refer to <EM>my</EM> system.)  Save your
changes and exit the editor.</P>
<P>That's it.  You may find it convenient to add the <TT>bin</TT> directory to
your <TT>&#36;PATH</TT> variable, but that's optional.  The next section is
worded assuming you have done this.</P>
<P><H3>Using the files to test your code</H3></P>
<P>You should read this entire subsection before using any of the testing
software.</P>
<P>The <TT>bin</TT> directory contains the file <TT>project-test.pl</TT> (which
you edited).  This is the file you will use most often, and it
may be the only file you ever use.  As with the other <TT>.pl</TT> files in
the directory, it is a Perl script that controls the execution of
several other processes, including building and running your programs
and testing their output against the solutions.  When you run
<TT>project-test.pl</TT>, you pass it the directory containing your source
code.  The program then moves into this directory and does the
following for each of the six possible tasks:
<UL>
<LI> looks for the .txt file you provide with instructions on building
and running your program for this task, if any (otherwise skips to
the next task);
<LI> attempts to build your program using the build command(s) you
provide;
<LI> runs your program a number of times on various
input files found under the <TT>test-suite</TT> directory, comparing your
output with the solutions (also under the <TT>test-suite</TT> directory).
</UL></P>
<P>To invoke the script, type<BR>
<TT><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;project-test.pl&nbsp;&lt;my-source-code-directory&gt;<BR>
</TT><BR>
at the shell prompt.</P>
<P>During its execution, the script puts comments into a file
<TT>comments.txt</TT> in your source code directory.  After the script
finishes, you should examine this file.  It contains routine messages
explaining what the script was doing and when, as well as any problems it
encountered.  Error messages are given in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS so that
they are easy to spot.  The end of the file contains a summary of what
the script found for each task.</P>
<P>You may run the script <TT>project-test.pl</TT> any number of times.  On
each run, the <TT>comments.txt</TT> file is overwritten, but a back-up file
<TT>comments.bak</TT> is created beforehand.</P>
<P>IMPORTANT: please be aware that, besides the comments file,
the script modifies your source code directory in other ways.
Here is a summary of the script's modifications:
<UL>
<LI> It creates any intermediate files used in compilation (such as
<TT>.o</TT> files), depending on your build instructions.  (It does not
remove these unless your instructions include commands to remove
them.)
<LI> It creates (and does not delete) any executable binaries resulting
from compiling your programs.
<LI> It creates the <TT>comments.txt</TT> and/or <TT>comments.bak</TT> files
described above.
<LI> It creates a file <TT>errlog.txt</TT> containing what you see on the
screen as the script executes.
<LI> It creates a temporary subdirectory <TT>test-outputs</TT> to hold the
outputs of your programs.  (This subdirectory is removed upon normal
completion of the script.)
</UL></P>
<P><H3>Other things you can do</H3></P>
<P>The <TT>bin</TT> directory contains other files you can use to test and
debug your programs.  There are three binary executables that are
called from the <TT>project-test.pl</TT> script but that you can also run
as stand-alone programs:
<UL>
<LI> <TT>isDFA</TT> reads text from standard input and reports whether or
not the input constitutes a correctly formatted DFA.  If so, it gives
the number of states and the alphabet.  For example:<BR>
<TT><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#36;&nbsp;isDFA&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;some&#95;random&#95;garbage&#95;file.txt<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not&nbsp;a&nbsp;DFA<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#36;&nbsp;./searcher&nbsp;str8.txt&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;isDFA<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;DFA&nbsp;with&nbsp;4096&nbsp;states&nbsp;and&nbsp;alphabet&nbsp;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz<BR>
</TT><BR>
<LI> <TT>DFAiso</TT> takes a DFA file as a command line argument (we'll
call it the <EM>reference DFA</EM>) and compares it with another DFA read
from standard input (the <EM>input DFA</EM>).  It reports whether or not the two DFAs are
isomorphic, that is, whether or not they are the same DFA up to
reordering of states.  The reference DFA must be sane, that is, all
states must be reachable from the start state.  If you use the command
line switch <TT>--loose</TT> (with two hyphens), the program will only
test isomorphism of the reference DFA with the reachable portion of
the input DFA.  This only matters if the input DFA is not sane.
(There is also a <TT>--strict</TT> option, but that's the default.)  For
example,<BR>
<TT><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#36;&nbsp;./minimizer&nbsp;nonminimalDFA2.txt&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;DFAiso&nbsp;minDFA2.txt<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;two&nbsp;DFAs&nbsp;are&nbsp;isomorphic.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;1<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;1<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#36;&nbsp;DFAiso&nbsp;minDFA3.txt&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;minDFA5.txt<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Accepting&nbsp;state&nbsp;discrepancy&nbsp;found:&nbsp;transition&nbsp;`0&acute;&nbsp;from&nbsp;states&nbsp;(0,0)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;two&nbsp;DFAs&nbsp;are&nbsp;different.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#36;&nbsp;DFAiso&nbsp;minDFA1.txt&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;nonminimalDFA7.txt<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sizes&nbsp;differ.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ref&nbsp;DFA:&nbsp;5&nbsp;states;&nbsp;input&nbsp;DFA:&nbsp;8&nbsp;states<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;two&nbsp;DFAs&nbsp;are&nbsp;different.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#36;&nbsp;DFAiso&nbsp;--loose&nbsp;minDFA1.txt&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;nonminimalDFA7.txt<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;two&nbsp;DFAs&nbsp;are&nbsp;isomorphic.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;1&nbsp;2&nbsp;3&nbsp;4<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;2&nbsp;4&nbsp;6&nbsp;7<BR>
</TT><BR>
If the DFAs are isomorphic, a matching of states between the two DFAs
is also displayed.
<LI> <TT>DFAequiv</TT> takes two DFA text files as arguments and reports
whether or not the DFAs are equivalent, that is, whether or not they
recognize the same language.  For example,<BR>
<TT><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#36;&nbsp;DFAequiv&nbsp;nonminimalDFA4.txt&nbsp;minDFA4.txt<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;two&nbsp;DFAs&nbsp;are&nbsp;equivalent.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#36;&nbsp;DFAequiv&nbsp;nonminimalDFA4.txt&nbsp;minDFA5.txt<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;two&nbsp;DFAs&nbsp;are&nbsp;not&nbsp;equivalent.<BR>
</TT><BR>
</UL></P>
<P>The other files in the <TT>bin</TT> directory are Perl scripts used to
generate and process test input files.  Comments near the top of these
files explain what they do and how to use them.  All their output is
to standard output.</P>
<P>You can copy and edit any of these files, including
<TT>project-test.pl</TT>.  For example, you can suppress the deletion of
the <TT>test-outputs</TT> subdirectory and its files by setting the
<TT>&#36;delete&#95;temps</TT> flag to 0 on line&nbsp;75, and you can adjust the
execution time-out limit on line&nbsp;64.
</P>
